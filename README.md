# Sunlight Meter

Using the Adafruit TSL2591 Digital Light Sensor and a Raspberry Pi to monitor daily sunlight conditions.  

## About
The [TSL2591](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1980) is a high dynamic range digital light sensor.  
It can detect infrared, full-spectrum and human-visible light, then transmit that data over a serial connection.   

By collecting this data, we are able to:  
- Calculate the lux value for the current light conditions.
- Report real-time data for monitoring or automation.
- Save historical data to give insight on changes over time.
- Provide a dashboard to control the sensor and visualize data.
- Most importantly, determine if your location is: ☁️ shade, partial shade, partial sun, or full sun ☀️

## Understanding Lux Values
From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux:  
| Illuminance (lux) | Surfaces illuminated by |
| --- | --- |
| 0.0001 | Moonless, overcast night sky (starlight) |
| 0.002 | Moonless clear night sky with airglow |
| 0.05–0.3 | Full moon on a clear night |
| 3.4 | Dark limit of civil twilight under a clear sky |
| 20–50 | Public areas with dark surroundings |
| 50 | Family living room lights |
| 80 | Office building hallway/toilet lighting |
| 100 | Very dark overcast day |
| 150 | Train station platforms |
| 320–500 | Office lighting |
| 400 | Sunrise or sunset on a clear day |
| 1000 | Overcast day; typical TV studio lighting |
| 10,000–25,000 | Full daylight (not direct sun) |
| 32,000–100,000 | Direct sunlight |
